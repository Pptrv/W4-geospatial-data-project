# Week 4 - Geospatial Data Project

## Finding the best location for my office

In this project I will analyse and compare various preferences my co-workers seek for their new office to decide which location benefits our working enivronmnet the most. 

My co-working preferences I will take into consideration are: 


1. We all want to be next to succesfull companies that have been founded during and after the 2008 economic crisis. 
2. The office dogâ€”"Pepe" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.
3. Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.

The first preference will determine the city we will locate the office. 
The second and third preference will determine if the coordinates our CEO has choosen meets the required preferences stablished by the co-workers. 

## Working Process

The work is divided into 3 different jupyter-notebooks (JN). 
    1. Apis
    2. Mongodb
    3. Choosing location

The first JN call the Apis from foursquare in order to find the starbucks and hairdressers location. It will print all the location next to our office coordinates. 

The second JN calls a dataset from Mongodb and shows the working process to clean the dataframe. 

Lastly, the third JN combines JN1 and JN2 in a cleaner way and explaining the results.
