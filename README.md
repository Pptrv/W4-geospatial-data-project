# Week 4 - Geospatial Data Project

## Finding the best location for my office

In this project I will analyse and compare various preferences my co-workers seek for their new office to decide which location benefits our working enivronmnet the most. 

My co-working preferences I will take into consideration are: 

1. Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
2. The office dogâ€”"Pepe" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.
3. Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.

I will assgin each variable a numeric value based on my subjetive knowledge of the company. In the final analysis the assigned vaue to each point we are analysing will help me make the final decision.
