# Week 4 - Geospatial Data Project

## Finding the best location for my office

In this project I will analyse and compare various preferences my co-workers seek for their new office to decide which location benefits our working enivronmnet the most. 

My co-working preferences I will take into consideration are: 

1. Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
2. We all want to be next to succesfull companies that have been founded during and after the 2008 economic crisis. 
3. The office dogâ€”"Pepe" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.
4. Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
